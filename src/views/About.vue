      To address the challenges posed by climate change to our cities, it is
      essential to acknowledge the role the environment plays in our everyday
      lives. However our maps tend to silence our lived experience and how it
      both shapes and is shaped by the places we move through. Consequently,
      planning and design processes have often disregarded this and lost great
      opportunities to collectively shape friendlier and human-oriented cities.
      An analysis of active mobility practices in the commune of Vernier offers
      us the chance to create alternative spatial representations to know this
      lived dimension. By having maps able to address affective engagements,
      social imaginaries, and collective memories, we can make our communities
      matter more in the conversations about our cities' future.
